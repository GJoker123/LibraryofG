<p>Hi Dad</p>
<p>Remember me?</p>
<p>Your authority and strictness frightened me at times as a child</p>
<p>When you used to yell at Brother</p>
<p>I would always feel pity for him</p>
<p>What did he do to deserve it?</p>
<p>Why such harshness in your voice?</p>
<p>I was always afraid whenever that anger would turn towards me</p>
<p>Like a lion that switches to weaker prey</p>
<p>I was always angry at how you would yell from the stairs</p>
<p>Telling me &ldquo;Stop making noise&rdquo; or &ldquo;be quiet&rdquo;</p>
<p>When at times it wasn&rsquo;t me at all!</p>
<p>I remember the times I came to you, depressed or lonely</p>
<p>And you would bat it away, grumpy and stagnant</p>
<p>That the Son you wished for</p>
<p>Was this coward who wished nothing more but to be forgotten</p>
<p>And yet</p>
<p>Everytime I came home</p>
<p>You would always warm up the food Mum made for me</p>
<p>And lie on the sofa</p>
<p>Looking after me.</p>
<p>Hey Dad</p>
<p>Remember me?</p>
<p>When we had that big argument</p>
<p>And I stormed out</p>
<p>Angry, upset</p>
<p>A storm to school</p>
<p>With you calling out to me</p>
<p>Saying &ldquo;Come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the first time I ignored you</p>
<p>The first time I stood up to you</p>
<p>And Yet</p>
<p>I cried and wanted to apologise</p>
<p>I never wanted to make you feel pain</p>
<p>I was angry</p>
<p>In vain</p>
<p>So, after I made that phonecall to you</p>
<p>And came home</p>
<p>I was relieved,</p>
<p>To see that we both loved each other still</p>
<p>And a hug was received</p>
<p>I understood you better</p>
<p>The Authority and Strictness</p>
<p>Laid way to the Love and Happiness</p>
<p>You wanted for your kids</p>
<p>As a young teen</p>
<p>I spent my time with you</p>
<p>Joyfully, lovingly</p>
<p>With some cheekiness I couldn&rsquo;t resist</p>
<p>Nevertheless</p>
<p>You shouting from the stairs</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop making Noise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still annoyed me to no end.</p>
<p>Hey Dad</p>
<p>Remember me?</p>
<p>Still a budding teenager</p>
<p>I felt the pressures of responsibility coming</p>
<p>I was so busy with coming up in life</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t notice that you started to drop down</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realise, when you fell</p>
<p>That it was a signal, that you rung the bell</p>
<p>With the coming of old age</p>
<p>You were coming to the conclusion</p>
<p>The final stage</p>
<p>I was worried when you began to disappear</p>
<p>Into the hospital</p>
<p>But I believed you make it out</p>
<p>After all</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t spent enough time</p>
<p>As Father and Son</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t taught me everything</p>
<p>That there was to being a boy</p>
<p>To being a man</p>
<p>Responsibilities</p>
<p>Family</p>
<p>How to ride a bike</p>
<p>I thought when you came to see us</p>
<p>All worn out by the curse of old age and disease</p>
<p>That you go back to that monotone white</p>
<p>And return back twice as strong</p>
<p>To stay with us, teaching me to be the best</p>
<p>So why, one morning in November</p>
<p>I woke up to my sisters, in a mess</p>
<p>Telling me that</p>
<p>You were put to rest?</p>
<p>The Pain I felt</p>
<p>The Grief we went through</p>
<p>So near to Christmas</p>
<p>And yet the present was Death</p>
<p>The Future Bleak</p>
<p>The Past, sorrowful</p>
<p>Hey Dad</p>
<p>Still here, Still me</p>
<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t have to tell you</p>
<p>But I will</p>
<p>The funeral went ahead</p>
<p>It was a success</p>
<p>Or so I heard</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t attend the burial</p>
<p>My head, in a mess, refuse to see you</p>
<p>Your black coffin, housing your decrepit body inside?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t face the Truth</p>
<p>And Dad?</p>
<p>I always regretted that</p>
<p>Considering I never visited the hospital once</p>
<p>The very least I could have done was see your soul released, right?</p>
<p>But no</p>
<p>The coward reared his head</p>
<p>Beneath the ground</p>
<p>And hid</p>
<p>And for that, I will always be sorry.</p>
<p>The Counselling was long</p>
<p>The school days was longer</p>
<p>The Depression?</p>
<p>A Journey</p>
<p>The days after you were painful</p>
<p>I will never deny</p>
<p>But as life went on</p>
<p>The Pain I felt</p>
<p>Began to turn into Regret</p>
<p>Into Ache</p>
<p>Into Memories</p>
<p>Eventually, as I near the deep end of my teenager years</p>
<p>Your Death</p>
<p>As a drowning presence</p>
<p>Dissipated</p>
<p>Into a Sunset</p>
<p>Showing my time with you</p>
<p>As a warm radiance.</p>
<p>Dear Dad</p>
<p>As a child</p>
<p>I feared and hated you</p>
<p>The one with the authority</p>
<p>Who harsh voice could bring me to tears</p>
<p>The one with the loving heart</p>
<p>Who took care of me and helped me grow.</p>
<p>As a young teen</p>
<p>I respected and loved you</p>
<p>As we go out to the park</p>
<p>With the sun out and a football in my hands</p>
<p>You were way too old to play 1 vs 1</p>
<p>But that never stopped you from trying to be in my life, did it?</p>
<p>As time continued its ever-going tune</p>
<p>You decided to skip its beat once in a while</p>
<p>To spend as much time as you had with me.</p>
<p>As a Teen</p>
<p>I cried and grieved for you</p>
<p>I asked myself why did you had to die?</p>
<p>Why did God give you to my brother, my sisters, my mother,</p>
<p>And me</p>
<p>Only to pull you away from us?</p>
<p>I remember, in my mad grief</p>
<p>My sisters told me having a father was better than not having one at all</p>
<p>But if you never experienced a father&rsquo;s love</p>
<p>How would you know the pain of having such love taken from you?</p>
<p>I felt my sanity slipping</p>
<p>&nbsp;At times</p>
<p>Due to the stress of everything that occurred during that dark era</p>
<p>Sometimes I asked myself if I snapped</p>
<p>Am I sane?</p>
<p>And yet, it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>Because my family was there for me during that torture</p>
<p>Comforting me, despite suffering.</p>
<p>So, if I&rsquo;m crazy and in the abyss</p>
<p>My family will always be there to pull me out</p>
<p>Along with you, Dad.</p>
<p>As an adult?</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie, I have grown</p>
<p>Placed to rest a lot of my demons</p>
<p>Including your funeral Dad</p>
<p>I went to Nigeria with Mum</p>
<p>And buried you in your home</p>
<p>A spiritual release</p>
<p>For the both of us</p>
<p>Furthermore, I&rsquo;ll gotten my GCSEs</p>
<p>And finishing up college</p>
<p>After this, the future is unknown to me</p>
<p>But the fear I used to have, is replaced with peace</p>
<p>As I know you will always be looking down on me</p>
<p>Funny enough</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;m loud</p>
<p>I can imagine you shouting that same phrase over and over</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop making that noise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weird, right?</p>
<p>And yet, it&rsquo;s like your presence is there to make sure I&rsquo;m doing alright</p>
<p>And I am, I always will be</p>
<p>Despite the obstacles and tribulations, I&rsquo;ll go through.</p>
<p>However, as an adult?</p>
<p>I still miss you.</p>
<p>And will always love you.</p>
