<p>Deep breaths. That what mom always says, take deep breaths and relax to calm a panicking mind; despite the situation, no matter the severity, always take deep breaths and look at the source of panic from a cool perspective, that how you survive she would always tell me.</p>
<p>Like that time in the jungle: struck in a pit of quicksand, furiously scrabbling about wasting my precious energy and quickening my own impending death. That is, until I calmed down and saw a branch to pull myself out from.</p>
<p>Or the sudden burst of a tire as I was driving down a steep road, causing me to swear uncontrollably as my life flash before my eyes as the car headed for the cliff. Fortunately, I managed to stop the car as one half already dangled off the cliff and, with slow and precise movements, managed to get out before the car toppled over into the rocky ravines.</p>
<p>And especially that time during the wedding. God, with the amount of deep breaths I was taking there was a high probability of me fainting!</p>
<p>But this is different. I can&rsquo;t relax or take a deep breath as I sink to the bottom of the sea, my lungs burning with the need for oxygen as I violently struggle with whatever is chained to my legs and dragging me to the murky depths of a watery hell. I feel like it been minutes now, and with each passing second I get more desperate as my lungs start to scream in agony and my body begins to numb as I rapidly approach the realisation of my death.</p>
<p>Finally I cannot hold out for any longer. I open my mouth and take in one, last breath.</p>
