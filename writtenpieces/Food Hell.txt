<p>As soon as I hear that clock chime my heart sinks to the depth of despair. Lunchtime, great, my favourite time of the day. A brief moment in time where I could shake off the shackles of work for an instant, take off to the nearest deli and busy myself savouring and enjoying a meal for what it is; Blissful. The conversation between co-workers weren&rsquo;t so bad either if I was in a good mood or if the food was that spectacular on a particular day. Today was not one of those days. In fact, I could feel my tastebuds shiver in repulsion at the idea of standing up from my seat, forced by the ravenous beast within my stomach to move to some dingy chicken store and ask for any old shit. Hell, I could even ask them to bring me some dead bodies with the heads cut off and the only responses I would get are a &ldquo;yes sir!&rdquo; and a slow walk into the kitchen, followed by my favourite meal &ndash; peanut butter and fried banana sandwich.</p>
<p>Confused? I&rsquo;ll explain. Peanut butter gives the bread a rich, creamy taste that excites the tastebuds while the sweetness of the banana caresses them. The combination of both ascends the level of taste to the point that makes your taste buds burst with pleasure. Hence why the peanut butter and fried banana sandwich being the most perfect breakfast, lunch and dinner in the universe.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re confused about the &ldquo;dead bodies&rdquo; thing? That basically due to some cosmic universe god who decided that I was the 1000<sup>th</sup> winner of something and thought that a granted wish should be the prize - Which is a great thing to happen to anyone, except for a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The process can happen at any time.</li>
<li>The wish granting process starts whenever the person says &ldquo;I wish&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>The process is conducted with the winner having no knowledge.</li>
<li>You cannot undo the wish when it has been granted.</li>
<li>No one decided to mention this to me at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so, when one of my co &ndash;worker decided that starting a conversation with me might have been worth passing the time for a while and ask what meal I would wish to eat everyday, I just had to go and open my mouth to reply with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could eat peanut butter and fried banana sandwiches everyday, then I could die of a heart attack with a smile on my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Except I can&rsquo;t die with a smile on my face, because I&rsquo;m too busy stuffing these sandwiches into my mouth, and because that stupid wish came with a immortality card that prevented me to simply kill myself. Or quit my lousy job. Or stop eating. Some cruel asshole out there has basically forced me to relive my days consisting of nothing but working and eating. God, I don&rsquo;t know how long I been like this, must have lost count after day 995.</p>
<p>As soon as I see the clock strike 2 o&rsquo;clock I immediately know what&rsquo;s coming. How couldn&rsquo;t I when I been through this a million times? I close my eyes but I still experience a white flash and find myself suddenly back in the office. Checking the clock it&rsquo;s 9 and I&rsquo;m struck at my desk, facing a computer screen with boxes and sheets already filled out, leaving me with nothing to do till lunchtime arrives and I&rsquo;m get sent to any shitty food store to savour and enjoy my &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; meal of the day &ndash; peanut butter and fried banana sandwich.</p>
<p>Fuck me right?</p>
