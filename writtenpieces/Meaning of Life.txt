<p>&ldquo;The meaning of life?&rdquo; The voice from the sky boomed, its delicate yet powerful tones vibrated through the air, shaking the man entire body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-Y-Yes my Lord. I-I wish to know the meaning of life&rdquo; the man squeaked as his repeated his question again. &ldquo;I w-wish to know my p-purpose in this life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm I see&hellip;&rdquo; The voice paused, signified by the sky above the man turning grey and cloudy, before it suddenly turned clear and bright as the voice started to reverberate throughout the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacob. To understand the meaning of life is to understand one&rsquo;s desire for freedom, desire for happiness and desire for order. Life is an obstacle. Filled with perils and dangers, to overcome such challenges will lead you to experience the true experience and reality of life. Look deep within yourself Jacob, for life isn&rsquo;t something that is just graspable and solid. It is created by those that live in it &ndash; those that survive and thrive in it. Life is the embodiment of everything &ndash; the good, the bad and the beautiful. Life is truly a mixture and it is up to people like you Jacob, to attain and have a sip of such an elixir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, what do you by such as message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am saying that you already know your purpose Jacob - and to an extent, the meaning of life. You simply just got to look deeper into your soul for all the answers I have prepared are already there. Now I must go Jacob for my time is ending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I ever see you again my Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually, in due time we will meet again Jacob. Goodbye and remember; you are special, just like all the things that I have created. Never forget that.</p>
<p>And with a flash of light so blinding Jacob had to shield his eyes, the sky returned to normal and the sun was shining again with the occasional cloud passing by.</p>
<p>When Jacob was able to open his eyes, he looked up and smiled, as special warmth flowed through his body. He began to walk, confident in his heart that he will discover himself in life.</p>
<p>And in time, he did.</p>
