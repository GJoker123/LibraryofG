<p>Ode To My Mother</p>
<p>Since from Birth</p>
<p>When the tremendous deity</p>
<p>Known as my Mother&rsquo;s Soul</p>
<p>Spilt into 4</p>
<p>And gave life to 4 Vessels</p>
<p>Each with their own lives and wills to live</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>Each with their own experiences</p>
<p>I, the last of these vessels</p>
<p>Have known our Mother to be a great woman</p>
<p>The woman that has cared for me, raised me</p>
<p>Scolded me, irritated and supported me</p>
<p>Through Hell and Heaven</p>
<p>Even during times of Sickness</p>
<p>Of Distress</p>
<p>Of Death</p>
<p>My Mother has taken the blunt of it all</p>
<p>And still made sure her Children were safe from the Pain</p>
<p>I cannot imagine, nor ignore the abundance of love she has shared</p>
<p>Not just to us, but to others as well</p>
<p>A shining example of St Teresa</p>
<p>And Yet</p>
<p>Much More</p>
<p>Mother</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
<p>For Guiding me, for allowing me to cherish moments that was</p>
<p>Sweet</p>
<p>Laughable</p>
<p>Painful</p>
<p>Sorrowful</p>
<p>Moments that allowed us to bond, to understand and to grow as individuals</p>
<p>For spending decades, after decades</p>
<p>Making sure we, the 4 Vessels</p>
<p>Grew up to make not only ourselves proud</p>
<p>But also, the Soul you placed inside each of us.</p>
<p>Thank You Gloria</p>
<p>With Love</p>
