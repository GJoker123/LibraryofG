<p>Hurts, doesn&rsquo;t it? Unpleasant, uncomfortable, unbearable &ndash; words used to describe the terrible feeling that is Pain. Some people would say Pain is unrelenting, a burning sensation that just has to make itself known whenever an organism make mistakes or injures themselves. Others, those that work in universities and laboratories, would try and explain Pain as a simply message, relayed from the nerve endings in parts of the body, telling the brain that the body is in danger and needs recovery. Finally, there are those that ignore the negativity that Pain brings, instead they believe that Pain is and can be an enjoyable experience. All in all, the majority of people believe Pain to be frightening, ruthless and a beacon. After all, when someone is exposed to fatal amounts of Pain the common solution is for the person to shut down, at which point they meet and maybe converse (if they&rsquo;re lucky) with one of Pain best friends&hellip;Death.</p>
<p>Pain is everywhere isn&rsquo;t it? In the streets, in countries and in entire continents, afflicting any organisms its can reach and consume. Whether it through disease, death or danger, Pain somehow manages to slip through every crook and cranny, spreading its infectious toxins wherever it goes. No use trying to stop or run away from it, in two minutes or in two years or however long it takes, Pain will eventually catch its prey &ndash; like a tiger with a deer. Trying to prolong that inevitably will only lead to more Pain or more likely, will lead to Death and no one wants that conclusion. Believe me, Death isn&rsquo;t as kind as Pain, cruel and unforgiving, Death will slither and captures it&rsquo;s prize. No second chances; no intervening force, no divine miracle, just a regular person vs Death. Terrifying.</p>
<p>You probably realised that Pain and Death are linked with one another. In a way they share a bond. While each can perform on their own, there are particular times when they both come together and create sparks. For example when, a person mutilated or killed with the elements, having to suffer the unspeakable acts of Pain and the unforgettable touch of Death. However, I prefer Pain more to Death. Pain has a range of skills with the ability to affect mentally or physically. Pain is like Time, gradually gnawing away at the mind and the body. Pushing a creature to limits before finally breaking them. Sometimes the creature survives, only to encounter Pain again in their short, primitive lives. It makes for great viewing from time to time. On the other hand, Death is just&hellip; boring. Its cold. Miserable. Either it quick or slow, depending on the mood its in. And it just leaves me feeling hollow and unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Understand. I see Pain differently to your kind. While Pain hurts and spreads suffering across your world, coming in different forms such as the aftermath of a loved one or the continuation of bullying or as the jagged scar of regret and humiliation, I see it as a necessary evil. Take the death of a loved one for example, if you didn&rsquo;t lose that special someone, how could you have cherished them? Or fully appreciate them? And if you weren&rsquo;t constantly pushed down and kicked upon, how would you have acquired the strength to stand up and fight back? That is why Pain exists, not only to make people suffer, weep and falter but to strengthen, prepare and give people the best chance at surviving life. This is because; with Pain comes another friend, an very important one &ndash; Happiness, an emotion that is usually associated with the successful people, people that managed to overcome Life&rsquo;s obstacles and stand tall. People that aren&rsquo;t afraid to encounter and accept Pain. Do you understand now? Pain isn&rsquo;t your enemy, its your <strong>best friend</strong>.</p>
<p>Now I understand that you have many questions but I&rsquo;m afraid that I must conclude at this point, as I&rsquo;m very busy with looking after others worlds. I&rsquo;m thinking of sending Pain and the rest of the other beings to those worlds, liven things up a bit and see if the creatures there can accomplish incredible feats like your kind has. To be honest, I&rsquo;m surprised your species managed to survive up to this point; I remember when it was just the pair frolicking in my garden&hellip; that was also the first time when I experienced Pain. I guess it fortunate that Pain doesn&rsquo;t discriminate or else I never would have been able to see you all grow and develop like this, make me glad that I made the right decision and entrusted my personal playground to the billions of you. On that note I must depart. Good luck with life and especially with your Pain. And remember&hellip;</p>
<p>Always keep your head high.</p>
