<p>The aftermath always leaves a sting. The broken vase. The tainted walls. The shining, gold liquid of cider travelling down the painting next to the front door, becoming a reminder of the destruction we caused. As I hear her desperate cries emanate from the bedroom, I lay on the sofa gripping the green bottle, replaying the dreadful scenes that lead to such a violent outcome. Constantly, like a broken record, I remember the words she spewed at me with no hesitation, sharp as daggers with no other intention but to cause malicious suffering;</p>
<p><strong>I wished it was you that died that day.</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the amount I consume, the impact of those words never lessens. I can still feel the hate, the malicious intent she had behind those words, the intent to make me suffer and grieve, as if I had gotten over the terrible ordeal and she hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I placed a hand over my eyes, sickened by the constant reminders of the hell we lived in. This tortuous, fake lives we live day by day, pretending we&rsquo;re recovering and surviving the aftermath of the incident, having to put on disguises to the neighbours, friends and family to avoid detection, and as soon as we get home, we descend into sadness and negativity &ndash; arguing, insulting and hating each other till the anger residing in us sleeps and we pretend that we don&rsquo;t mean any of the things we said, cuddling, consoling, kissing till we become a real couple again. Until the next tiny thing sets us off again.</p>
<p>Except this time, instead of the usual &ldquo;why!?&rdquo; and &ldquo;You should have done something!&rdquo; she uttered those forbidden words. This time, she didn&rsquo;t aim to make me feel guilty; she just wanted me to feel pain.</p>
<p>The same pain she felt ever since the incident&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad! When are we going to reach the store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, soon Princess, just hold tight and wait and daddy will buy you the most expensive, best-looking toy that anyone could have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yayy! I love you Daddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were the last words I heard from her&hellip; before the crash. Apparently, the other driver was drunk driving and speeding at 70mph; he had no chance of swerving. I had no chance to react. She had no chance to survive.</p>
<p>As the car door was being wrenched from the crumbled heap that used to resemble my car I saw the fireman carried my daughter towards the stretcher. At once, I felt a lump in my stomach and throat as I saw the blood dripping from her. Blood running from her head was mixing with the gasoline on the tarmac, swirling like the dark thoughts inside my head.</p>
<p>The waiting at the hospital was mind-numbingly long for the both of us. Me, holding my head in my hands, replaying the horrible scene in my head and imagining what I should have done to avoid the car, her, trying to comfort me and telling me it wasn&rsquo;t my fault, that our daughter will pull through in the end. It was pointless though, I knew our daughter had died. If the blood running from her petite mouth and head coupled with the lack of breathing wasn&rsquo;t enough, then the looks on the paramedic faces should have been. I couldn&rsquo;t tell my wife though, I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell her &ndash; and I also wanted to envelope in my wife&rsquo;s belief that our beautiful daughter would survive.</p>
<p>In the end however, it didn&rsquo;t matter. The moment she saw the disheartened look on the doctor&rsquo;s face she lost hope for a miracle. And with it, her love for life.</p>
<p>I drop the empty bottle onto the cold floor, removing my hand from my face as the intoxicating effect of the alcohol runs through my veins and comfort me, making me invulnerable to the daggers struck inside my heart, allowing me temporary relief to sleep till morning, where I know I will have to confront my wife at the breakfast table, feigning ignorance of this terrible night whilst knowing a line has been crossed which cannot be buried under the sand and forgotten.</p>
<p>As I began the journey to sleep, I notice a figure walking toward me from the corner of my eye. I turn my head and see her - my wife, red eyed and a hollow shell of herself. She stops walking and stares at me, trembling slightly. No words are spoken between us. The nastiness of tonight hangs over us like a suffocating fog. I begin to speak when suddenly; she walks towards me and embraces me in a tight hug. Instinctively, I cover my arms around her and lock her in a tight embrace, warmed by her touch.</p>
<p>The silence is broken by the sound of light sobbing and as our tears flow, I&rsquo;m reminded of a simple life, a happier life with me, my wife and our precious daughter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The aftermath always leaves a sting. The silence. The peace. The golden light from the lamp bathing us in its warm glow. As I hear her light sobbing fill the room, I stay still, hugging my wife with love and conviction, desperate to make amends and help her recover from this ordeal. Between her sobs I can hear her mutter sorry over and over again. I hug even harder. And eventually, like a broken record, we repeat the words that should have been said;</p>
<p><strong>I love you.</strong></p>
