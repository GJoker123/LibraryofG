<p><strong><u>Distance</u></strong></p>
<p>Welcome to my hell. Glad you came; I had a lot of stuff to sort out. First things first; I saw that you had a little accident with the thing that sent you here. Well, when I say &ldquo;little&rdquo; I really meant that that thing completely tore you apart: flesh, bone and guts. Whew, I was reeling for a minute when that happened, Lord knows that must have been painful. Maybe even so painful that you forgot? Don&rsquo;t worry? Everyone get that dazed look on your face around here, it&rsquo;s kind of the normality that experienced here. Nevermind though heh? You get used to it and eventually remember your memories. Unfortunately for you, once you do... Well, let say you probably won&rsquo;t be as ignorantly blissful as you are now. No, you probably be screaming and shrieking and basically harming yourself to distract yourself from the pain, desperate to destroy whatever left of your mind to induce a full purge and start off clean; like a baby. A brain-dead baby. But until that happens... Enjoy yourself!</p>
<p><strong><u>Trust</u></strong></p>
<p>Lost One, come and step into the kingdom of light and eradicate the shadows that trail behind you. Yes, you. Please, the light welcomes you and will cleanse you of your sins and troubles. I know you had been furiously beaten by the world, by life, by the darkness &ndash; but all of that ends now. I welcome you, petite sheep, to join me and the rest of the denizens here to bath in the warm glow that is called Paradise. I understand your wariness, considering that throughout your life you have been given hope, only to have it turn to malicious lies. Throughout life you have suffered endlessly: broken homes, vile crimes, bitter brutality and hollow promises. No wonder one such as you would approach such a place with caution and deep down; hostility. However, all of that ends here. Once you have taken the final step into this gleaming world, you will truly receive the peace and hope that has been denied from you for so long - far too long. Now, receive my hand and with it, your trust and your desire for happiness will be fully fulfilled.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>You didn&rsquo;t really believe that, did you?</strong></p>
