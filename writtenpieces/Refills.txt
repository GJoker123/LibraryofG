<p>I&rsquo;m tired of this world.</p>
<p>From the beginning I was cursed. Born with a breathing difficulty and having to carry that oxygen tank around did nothing for my place in society hierarchy. The looks of pity, the laughs of mocking hatred and the expressions on people faces that labelled me as a freak. All inflicting wounds upon me like daggers seeped in poison. I had no parents to depend on as they disappeared without a trace, leaving me on the doorstep of an orphanage where I spent years living a miserable existence. For a brief moment I thought that my problems would be solved once I was identified with the power gene. The idea of having a powerful ability and being accepted into a school where people who also have the gene would respect and understand me despite my appearance and disability sounded like a dream. Allowing me to discover myself and find confidence.</p>
<p>Then I and everybody else realised my power.</p>
<p>I was the laughing stock of the school. The teachers, my protectors, would smirk or suppress a chuckle behind my back or when they thought I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. The students would mock me about it at every available chance they would get, &ldquo;accidently&rdquo; spilling their drinks over me and saying that I was at fault, that I better refill them or else. And those that weren&rsquo;t particularly mean to me were only pretending to be my friends to sustain their high fatty diets; using me like as if I was only a tool, a discount offer that never expires.</p>
<p>Even then, the torment at that school was small compared to the torment I suffer on a daily basis after I graduated. Employers don&rsquo;t want a weak person that can hardly do anything without requiring a break every two hours and most jobs feel like my ability would be a liability than a useful skill. No one wants a hero who cannot save others or stop crime so the hero committee was quick to cut me out of the pay scheme they devised to support upcoming heroes. The only place where I could get respite and work is at the orphanage I was raised in and I can feel the stinging roars of laugher from the other workers of jokes at my expense mixed with the disgusting stares of sympathy I get from the children.</p>
<p>Eventually I had enough of this torment. I decided I was going to get respect. Everybody would receive the message that I was going to send to the world&hellip;</p>
<p>You see, spending the majority of your life by yourself allowed me to notice something about this power. The ability to refill something requires a thing to exist. It also requires the thing to have a decrease in matter, in order to replace the space with the same type of substance that was lost &ndash; hence the &ldquo;refilling&rdquo; part. Furthermore, I noticed that the duration of this ability can be continuous until either I stop it or the thing is filled to its original amount. While these limitations may be annoying, I have also noticed the lack of constraints that affect this power. Time, for example, has no real significance. If the substance currently exists and is diluted, it <strong>can</strong> be refilled, regardless of how much time has passed between its current state and its original state. Speed is also an irrelevant factor; I can refill anything at the pace of a crippled slug or in the time it takes to blink an eye &ndash; hell, the process can even be instantaneous if I felt like it. The best thing though is the lack of restriction on the type of matter that can be refilled. Gases, liquids, solids, they are all refillable to me &ndash; there is nothing I cannot touch and manipulate.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point. Life in that despicable school &ndash; while boring and suffering - has managed to teach me some useful information, especially during the science lessons. For example, the concentration of oxygen is 21% while carbon dioxide is only 0.04% due to numerous factors such as photosynthesis, but during the Earth&rsquo;s juvenile phrase the concentration of carbon dioxide was incredibly high. Therefore, it seems that a decrease has occurred over the ages, and as such, it only seems right that I should refill the amount of carbon dioxide lost to its original amount, right? After all, I&rsquo;m a hero and it is in a hero&rsquo;s duty to help others by using their powers to the fullest.</p>
