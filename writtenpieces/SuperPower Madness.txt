<p>70%. The blue line on the computer screen was close to reaching the finish line and once it had, Zack would have acquired his desired power. Already he could imagine the look on his friends&rsquo; faces, his crush&rsquo;s sudden approval and the money that would soon flow from his fingertips. What was going to be a mere dream would finally become a reality. Despite the warnings displayed by those anti-superpower sites and the images of those who suffered the negative effect of downloading powers, Zack was determined to acquire his power at all cost. What happened to them was due to their own idiocy and being too incompetent to read simple instructions and check for viruses. Not Zack though, no, he was smarter than the rest of them and prepared thoroughly for this moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All he had to do now was wait.</p>
<p>Bang! A loud noise thundered through the sky and suddenly everything in Zack&rsquo;s room was black. It seems the thunderstorm outside caused an electrical discharge to occur, blowing the fuse and causing a blackout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Immediately, Zack felt a rush of energy surged through his body, passing and restructuring the DNA of each cell within him, much to Zack bewilderment and happiness to the realisation of power within him. However, did the download reach 100% before the blackout? Zack decided not to ponder this &ndash; it must have or else a failsafe system within the website would have denied him attaining such power. Either way he would test out this power at school, amaze everybody and gather the attention of all the hot girls. As such, Zack dreamed of fame, happiness and power as he slept.</p>
<p>The next day at school, Zack was ready. He already told his friends to gather everybody in school towards the assembly, where he would show off his power. Already, the energy rumbled inside of him, ready to be released at any moment. Eventually, most of the students arrived in the assembly, some with a bored expression on their faces whilst others were expectantly waiting.</p>
<p>Zack knew that the time has come. Seizing up all the power within him, he stretched out his arms and began to materialise his thoughts into reality. As expected, luxurious objects came forth out of air: pieces of money, fine jewellery, designer&rsquo;s clothes, gold, everything Zack could think of and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shocked, the students were still. Then, as if a volcano erupting, they all broke into action; rushing towards the trove of treasure to grab and pocket. Thousands of hands were all over the items, grabbing as much as they can before stuffing into bags, pockets and onto their person. Their lustful desire and greed were only matched by Zack&rsquo;s happiness and feeling of triumph. With this power, he knew he would be respected, feared, and loved by everybody. With this power, Zack felt like he could conquer the worl-</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but there is a slim chance of him coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The doctor&rsquo;s words struck in her like a spear coated with poison. Instantly she fell to her knees as the feelings of despair and sorrow welled up in her, bursting through in the form of sobs. As the deafening sobs continued, the doctor coughed awkwardly and began to leave the room, hoping the nurses could clean up the mess. As he reached towards the door, he turned back to observe the patient lying on the bed; eyes closed with no movement except for the tiny rise within his chest. He looked away and shook his head, he seen too many people like him to have any sympathy. They knew the risks and still went ahead and as such, suffered the consequences. The only concern he had was for the mother, suffering from the traumatic experience of finding their child comatose in their room, doomed to be trapped in their mind with no chance of returning to reality. Leaving only the prospect of death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With a deep breath, the doctor left the room.</p>
