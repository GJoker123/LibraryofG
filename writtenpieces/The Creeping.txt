<p>It began at midnight in the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At first a simple tap, rhythmic and slow, the sounds produced were light, so light that they were barely audible in the night. Despite such soft sounds, the man was woken, disoriented by the unusual disturbance. The tapping repeated itself slowly and insistently playing the same rhythm, eventually devouring the man&rsquo;s thoughts, replacing them with thoughts of death. Eventually the tempo increased, and increased in volume till it became unbearable. As the taps continued to drum the deafening sounds, broken in rhythm, his brain begun to break, falling into insanity as each tap sent mixtures of fear and torment across the mind.</p>
<p>Dreams became corrupted; the ideal paradise of peace and happiness became a wasteland filled with cold and darkness.</p>
<p>His view turned blurry as his functions began to terminate.</p>
<p>Eventually his brain snapped, and his consciousness started to fade, disappearing into nothingness as the tapping finally resided.</p>
<p>Morning arrived. The air came alive through the sounds of birds singing, of insects buzzing around in the sky and the fresh breeze flowing through patches of grass. As the radiance of the sun reached the windows of the house, the beautiful scene was ruined by the sight of the pale - faced man laid out on the bed, his face frozen in a state of terror and torture as a grim reminder as to what has taken place last night.</p>
<p>It has taken another victim.</p>
