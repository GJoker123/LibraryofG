<p>I ran today</p>
<p>Left my house with ambition</p>
<p>Football was the usual tradition</p>
<p>Especially match day.</p>
<p>I ran today</p>
<p>Met my friends to catch up</p>
<p>Ate some chips with ketchup</p>
<p>Almost forgot to pay.</p>
<p>I ran today</p>
<p>The line was really slow</p>
<p>The people were aged old</p>
<p>Eventually I turned away.</p>
<p>I ran today</p>
<p>Left my house with excitement</p>
<p>Met my friends with a statement</p>
<p>Showed them the enticement</p>
<p>I felt defiant.</p>
<p>I ran today</p>
<p>Bright light surrounds me</p>
<p>Endless noise envelop me</p>
<p>I went on a spree</p>
<p>And now, I must</p>
<p>Flee.</p>
<p>I walked today;</p>
<p>Regret filled me</p>
<p>My dreams betrayed me</p>
<p>As I drew closer</p>
<p>To the past.</p>
<p>I ran today</p>
<p>And never stopped.</p>
